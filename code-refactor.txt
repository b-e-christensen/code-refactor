Changes made: 
Header class changed to <header> 

Fixed broken anchor link within web page. 

Collapsed classes in CSS selector to be grouped with others with the same attributes. 

--TO DO-- 
change div elements to semantic html elements. Right off the bat I can see the header div would be better as a <nav>
